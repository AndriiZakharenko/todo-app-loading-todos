# Todo App Load Todos

## 🎮 About the Project
This is the first part of the **Todo App** project, where the functionality to **load todos** is implemented. It includes the ability to fetch data from an external API, handle loading and error messages, and filter the todos by their status. The project consists of three parts:

1. [Load Todos](https://github.com/AndriiZakharenko/todo-app-loading-todos) - Fetches and displays todos from the API.
2. [Add and Delete](https://github.com/AndriiZakharenko/todo-app-add-and-delete) - Adds and deletes todos.
3. [Toggle and Rename](https://github.com/AndriiZakharenko/todo-app-with-api) - Allows toggling and renaming todos.

This particular part demonstrates how to load todos and filter them based on their status using data fetched from an external API.
